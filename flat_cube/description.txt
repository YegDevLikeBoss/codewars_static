You and your friend Denis study at Computer science faculty. Denis is good at math, while you are better at coding. Someday you asked Denis help you with math homework for the whole semester and offered him to code his course work, flat Rubik's cube game, instead. Luckily he accepted.

Flat Rubik's cube is 2-dimensional variety of Rubik's cube. Initial state of the game is shown on image below.

There is one central piece (enclosed in a circle) for each of 5 faces. Each two adjacent faces share 1 edge piece and 2 corner pieces. For exampe if you rotate edge #1 90° clockwise, you will get folowing result.

Your task is to create FlatCube class, that implements flat Rubik's cube puzzle. Class must have `rotate([face])` method that receives a list of integers in range [0..5], and rotates given face clockwise by 90°.
If list is empty, cube should stay in initial state. Methog will recieve only valid list, with valid face numbers.

Also class must have `python __str__()` method that returns cube in the folowwing format
